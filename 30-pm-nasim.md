# 30 PM - Tasks Completed (Nasim)

- Implemented recursive search across subfolders:
  - Backend: added `GET /api/search` to recursively list R2 objects under `unzipped/`, filter by query, and paginate via cursor
  - Frontend: search bar now performs global search (current prefix + all subfolders) with results list

- Pagination and state handling:
  - Search results support Prev/Next using cursors (page size 10)
  - Navigating to a folder clears the search input and resets search state

- Sorting and UX parity:
  - Search results respect existing sort options (name/date/size)
  - Normal folder browsing and pagination remain unchanged

- Linting:
  - Verified no linter errors in updated backend and frontend worker files

# 30 PM - Tasks Completed (Nasim)

- Multi-file upload support in frontend:
  - Enabled selecting/dropping multiple `.zip` files (`multiple` input, multi-file DnD)
  - Added upload queue with max 2 concurrent file uploads; extras wait
  - Per-file progress bars and statuses (Queued/Uploading/Completed/Failed)
  - Can add files while other uploads are in progress (auto-queued/start)
  - Kept per-file chunk concurrency at 5; existing retry/abort logic unchanged

- UI/UX updates:
  - Updated dropzone copy to reference "ZIP files"
  - Added `uploadsList` panel rendering active uploads with progress

- Configurability:
  - Introduced `MAX_PARALLEL_FILE_UPLOADS` constant to tune file-level concurrency

- Backend:
  - No changes needed; API already supports concurrent uploads per file

- Quality:
  - Verified no linter errors in modified `frontend-worker/src/index.js`

# 30 PM - Tasks Completed (Nasim)

- Frontend SPA persistence and routing:
  - Served a unified app shell for `/upload` and `/files` via `getAppPage`
  - Added client-side router (history push/pop) to toggle sections without reload
  - Kept `UploadManager` and progress UI mounted; upload continues across views
  - Highlighted active nav state and prevented default link navigation

- Files list integration inside SPA:
  - Embedded Files view alongside Upload view with breadcrumb, search, sort, pagination
  - Hooked Refresh/Prev/Next and delegated item actions (download/delete)
  - Preserved per-page cursors and prefix navigation within the SPA context

- Quality and maintenance:
  - Verified no linter errors in `frontend-worker/src/index.js`
  - Kept CORS handling and backend endpoints unchanged


# 30 PM - Tasks Completed (Nasim)

- Code cleanup and de-duplication:
  - Removed unused `getUploadPage` and `getFilesPage` from `frontend-worker/src/index.js`
  - Kept unified SPA via `getAppPage`; no behavior changes
  - Verified no linter errors after cleanup

# 30 PM - Tasks Completed (Nasim)

- Implemented recursive search across subfolders:
  - Backend: added `GET /api/search` to recursively list R2 objects under `unzipped/`, filter by query, and paginate via cursor
  - Frontend: search bar now performs global search (current prefix + all subfolders) with results list

- Pagination and state handling:
  - Search results support Prev/Next using cursors (page size 10)
  - Navigating to a folder clears the search input and resets search state

- Sorting and UX parity:
  - Search results respect existing sort options (name/date/size)
  - Normal folder browsing and pagination remain unchanged

- Multi-file upload support in frontend:
  - Enabled selecting/dropping multiple `.zip` files (`multiple` input, multi-file DnD)
  - Added upload queue with max 2 concurrent file uploads; extras wait
  - Per-file progress bars and statuses (Queued/Uploading/Completed/Failed)
  - Can add files while other uploads are in progress (auto-queued/start)
  - Kept per-file chunk concurrency at 5; existing retry/abort logic unchanged

- UI/UX updates:
  - Updated dropzone copy to reference "ZIP files"
  - Added `uploadsList` panel rendering active uploads with progress

- Frontend SPA persistence and routing:
  - Served a unified app shell for `/upload` and `/files` via `getAppPage`
  - Added client-side router (history push/pop) to toggle sections without reload
  - Kept `UploadManager` and progress UI mounted; upload continues across views
  - Highlighted active nav state and prevented default link navigation

- Files list integration inside SPA:
  - Embedded Files view alongside Upload view with breadcrumb, search, sort, pagination
  - Hooked Refresh/Prev/Next and delegated item actions (download/delete)
  - Preserved per-page cursors and prefix navigation within the SPA context

- Code cleanup and de-duplication:
  - Removed unused `getUploadPage` and `getFilesPage` from `frontend-worker/src/index.js`
  - Kept unified SPA via `getAppPage`; no behavior changes
  - Verified no linter errors after cleanup

- Frontend worker refactor (shrink + asset extraction):
  - Moved SPA inline CSS into `frontend-worker/src/assets/app.css.js` exporting `APP_CSS`
  - Moved SPA inline JS into `frontend-worker/src/assets/app.js` exporting `APP_JS`, adapted to read `BACKEND_URL` from `window.__CONFIG__`
  - Worker now serves `/assets/app.css` and `/assets/app.js` with correct `Content-Type` and CORS headers
  - Updated `getAppPage` to inject `window.__CONFIG__ = { BACKEND_URL }`, link external CSS/JS, and remove the large inline `<style>`/`<script>` blocks
  - Removed the legacy page renderers (`getUploadPage`, `getFilesPage`); SPA serves `/`, `/upload`, `/files`
  - Result: reduced `frontend-worker/src/index.js` from ~1700 lines to ~180 lines for better maintainability

- Smoke tests after refactor:
  - Uploads: simple and multipart ZIP uploads succeed with progress UI intact
  - Files view: listing, sorting, pagination, search, download, delete all verified
  - Navigation: SPA routing between `/upload` and `/files` works (history + active tab)
  - Lint: no errors introduced

- UI sizing adjustments (dropzone and layout):
  - Increased app max width to 1280px (`.app { max-width: 1280px }`)
  - Made dropzone shorter: `.upload-card { min-height: clamp(120px, 20vh, 160px) }`
  - Tuned dropzone icon to 40px for visual balance
